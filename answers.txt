Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging: Combines the changes from two branches by creating a new "merge commit" that preserves the history of both branches. 
    It results in a non-linear history.
        Rebasing: Moves or "replays" commits from one branch onto another, 
    creating a linear history by applying your changes on top of the target branch without a merge commit.
